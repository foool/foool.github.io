<p><a name="task_turnaround_time"></a><b>Task turnaround time</b> is the
elapsed time between start and finish of the task. If the task is not 
preempted, the task turnaround time equals the task execution time.

<p><a name="task_execution_time"></a><b>Task execution time</b> is the time
between task start and finish, when the task is actually running and not 
preempted by another task. The task execution time cannot be measured 
directly; it is inferred from the task start and finish time and the 
intervening periods during which another task has preempted it. Note that, 
in performing these calculations, processor time consumed by the scheduler 
while switching tasks is not taken into account. This means that, in cases 
where preemption occurs, the reported task execution times overestimate 
the true values.
