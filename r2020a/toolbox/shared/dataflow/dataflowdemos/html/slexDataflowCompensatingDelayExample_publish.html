%% About Dataflow
% With dataflow, blocks inside the domain execute based on arrival of data

% Introduction to Dataflow for Multithreading in Simulink> example. 
%
% To take advantage of dataflow domain, hence multithreaded simulation,
% your model or section of your model must have only discrete-time blocks.
% Placing the section of your model with only discrete-time blocks in a

%% Introduction
% This example uses dataflow to simulate an audio processing system that
% performs audio multiplexing on multiple threads. The dataflow region of
% the model is in a Dataflow Subsystem, which includes a Matrix Encoder and
% Matrix Decoder subsystem. The encoder generates a stereo signal from a
% four-channel audio signal using matrix encoding, and then recovers the
% original channels from the stereo mix using matrix decoding. The "Audio

%% Block to Thread Allocation
% For this model, we can see how Simulink partitions the blocks inside the
% Dataflow Subsystem into threads using the Dataflow Multithreading
% Analysis app. This app can be opened by double-clicking the Dataflow
% Multithreading Analysis App block in the model. The Thread Timing diagram
% in the app shows how blocks are assigned to threads. In this app, you
% can view estimated speedup, compared to single-threaded simulation, for
% different delays by choosing the menu option "Analysis->Performance
% Tradeoff->Speedup & Threads vs. Delays". This diagram shows the estimated
% speedup that can be obtained for different delay values. From this
% analysis, we can see that a delay value of 3 gives maximum speedup.
% Simulink uses pipeline delays to break data dependencies in the dataflow
% region to create concurrency and run the model on multiple threads. In
% the next section we will see how to compensate for this delay in signals
% that do not go through the dataflow region.

%% Compensating for Latency
% Simulink added pipeline delays in the Dataflow Subsystem to create
% concurrency. These pipeline delays delay the signal at the output of the
% dataflow region, compared to signals that are not processed by the
% dataflow region. All signals that go through the dataflow region will
% undergo this delay. This delay needs to be accounted for in signals that
% do not go through the dataflow region if such signals will be joined or
% compared to signals processed by the dataflow region. In this example,
% the dataflow region introduces a total delay of 3 sample periods. This is
% the number of delays that is set in the Dataflow Configuration block
% inside the Dataflow Subsystem.
%
% The signals that are output from the matrix encoder and decoder blocks
% will have these 3 extra delays before going into "Audio Player Selector"
% block. However, the "Audio input" signal which also goes into the "Audio
% Player Selector" did not go through the dataflow region, and hence does
% not have any additional delay. In order to align this signal with the
% other two signals, this signal needs to be delayed by the same amount as
% the signals from dataflow region. We have added a Delay block named
% "Compensating Delay" in the "Audio input" signal for this purpose. The 3
% sample period delay introduced in the dataflow region corresponds to 3
% time steps outside the dataflow region. Since the "Audio input" signal
% contains 1024 samples in each channel per time step, we set the delay in
% number of samples as 1024*3 in the delay block. We also set "Input
% Processing"  parameter in the delay block to "Columns as channels (frame
% based)" to delay each audio channel by the same delay length. Adding this
% delay block will align all the signals going into "Audio Player Selector"
% block in this model.

%% Performance Analysis
% By creating a dataflow region in the model with the Dataflow Subsystem it
% enabled Simulink to automatically partition the blocks in that region
% into concurrent execution threads. In this section we compare the
% performance of this multithreaded model with that of a single-threaded
% model that does not use dataflow. We can measure the amount of speedup
% obtained in the dataflow model by dividing the execution time taken by
% the model using multiple threads with the execution time taken by a model
% using a single thread. The model using a single thread does not use a
% Dataflow Subsystem, and hence does not use dataflow semantics. Execution
% time is measured using the output of the sim command. To isolate the
% impact of multithreading the dataflow region on simulation performance,
% the measurement includes only the run-time of the model and does not
% include the time it takes for the model to update and terminate.
%
% While measuring the execution time the "Audio Player Selector" block is
% commented since the audio player runs in real-time and could block
% Simulink from running if there is too much data to play. The speedup
% number is computed and shown below. This number could be different from
% the estimated speedup shown in the Dataflow Multithreading Analysis app.
% This difference could arise from thread overhead and cache performance
% when running the model in multithreaded mode. Also, the estimated speedup
% considers only blocks inside dataflow domain, while the actual time
% measurement is of the entire model.

multithreadedExecTime = simulateExample(model_name,'StopTime','300');
fprintf('Simulation execution time for multithreaded model = %.2fs/n', multithreadedExecTime);
singleThreadedModel = 'slexDataflowCompensatingDelaySingleThreadedExample';
open_system(singleThreadedModel);
set_param([singleThreadedModel '/Audio Player Selector'], 'Commented', 'on');
singleThreadedExecTime = simulateExample(singleThreadedModel,'StopTime','300');

%% Thread Allocation Results
% The partitioning of the Dataflow Subsystem into threads can be seen by
% turning thread highlighting "on" using the menu option
% "Display->Highlight Dataflow Threads". For this model, 4 different
% threads used by the dataflow region are shown using 4 different colors. A
% virtual subsystem that contains blocks running in different threads is
% shown with black highlighting. For example, the Matrix Encoder and Matrix
% Decoder blocks show black highlighting, while the blocks inside these
% subsystems run in different threads. The Thread Legend window can be used
% to selectively highlight only some threads for inspecting the model.
