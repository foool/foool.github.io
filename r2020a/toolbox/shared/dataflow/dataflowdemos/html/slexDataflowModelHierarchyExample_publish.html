%% About Dataflow
% With dataflow, blocks inside domain execute based on arrival of data as
% opposed to the Simulink timing engine, and models are automatically
% partitioned into concurrent threads that accelerate simulation and
% increase data throughput. For an introduction to dataflow see the

%% Summary
% This example shows how a video processing system simulation model

% using multiple threads. Dataflow Multithreading Analysis app shows how

% depending on the desktop computer system and the processor you are using,
% the numbers and visualization showed could be different when you run the
