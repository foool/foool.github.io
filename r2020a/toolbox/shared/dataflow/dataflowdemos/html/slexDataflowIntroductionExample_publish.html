Signals entering the Dataflow Subsystem lose their association with a sample time; therefore, blocks in the dataflow region cannot depend on the signal's sample time. Once a signal leaves the Dataflow Subsystem, it gets associated with the sample time it had before entering the Dataflow Subsystem. All the blocks inside the Dataflow Subsystem form a dataflow region in the model which enables that portion of the model to execute using concurrent threads. The "Random Integer" source block needs time and uses the SampleTime parameter to produce a time-based signal output. Therefore, it is not included in the Dataflow Subsystem. Dataflow Subsystems are used to delineate the region of the model where sample time is not needed. For example, when using a block that uses time like a source block or a scope block it can't be included in the Dataflow Subsystem. Dataflow Subsystems include a Dataflow Configuration block and have a badge on their lower-left corner to differentiate it from other Simulink subsystems.</p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="slexDataflowIntroductionExample_publish_02.png" alt=""> <h2 id="5">Analyzing Model for Parallelism</h2><p>This model contains a chain of blocks that are data dependent.

You can visualize the threads used to simulate the model by using the Dataflow Multithreading Analysis app. To open the app, double-click the Dataflow Multithreading Analysis App block in the model. The Thread Timing diagram shows that because of the sequential nature of the flow of data and the data dependency between blocks, only a single thread can be used for this model. The data dependency between the blocks in the model prevents blocks from being executed concurrently.</p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="slexDataflowIntroductionExample_publish_03.png" alt=""> <h2 id="6">Removing Data Dependency to Create Concurrency</h2><p>By pipelining the data dependent blocks we can increase concurrency.

When you update the model, Simulink provides information about the optimal number of pipeline delays that needs to be set in the Dataflow Subsystem to get maximum concurrency. Simulink shows the recommended number of pipeline delays in the form of an information badge in the lower-left corner of the Dataflow Subsystem. Clicking this badge reveals the latency budget set for the Dataflow Subsystem and the corresponding number of threads it will use.

% execute based on availability of data as opposed to Simulink's sample
% time, and the blocks are automatically partitioned into concurrent

% single thread. Execution time is measured using the output of the sim
% command and includes only the run-time of the model and does not include

%% Converting a Model to Use Dataflow
% In Simulink, you create a dataflow region using a Dataflow Subsystem.

%% Removing Data Dependency to Create Concurrency
% By pipelining the data dependent blocks we can increase concurrency.
% Dataflow can create parallelism in the model by introducing pipeline
% delays between the blocks in the dataflow domain; therefore, breaking the
% dependency between the blocks. When you update the model, Simulink
% provides information about the optimal number of pipeline delays that
% needs to be set in the Dataflow Subsystem to get maximum concurrency.
% Simulink shows the recommended number of pipeline delays in the form of
% an information badge in the lower-left corner of the Dataflow Subsystem.
% Clicking this badge reveals the latency budget set for the Dataflow
% Subsystem and the corresponding number of threads it will use. The
% following diagram shows the presence of this badge and the corresponding
% message in the model.

% <<slexLatencyBadgePix.png>>
%
% For this model, the recommended number of pipeline delays is 4. By
% setting this value in the Dataflow Configuration block, Simulink uses it
% to create concurrency in the Dataflow Subsystem. After setting the number
% of pipeline delays, when you update the model Simulink shows you the
% locations where pipeline delays are introduced using $Z^{-n}$ tags on the
% signal line. Since this model has a long chain of blocks that are data
% dependent without any inherent parallelism, dataflow creates parallelism
% from this model by adding pipeline delays between blocks. The diagram

% pipeline delays introduced in the dataflow region.

%% Compensating for Pipeline Delays
% When pipeline delays are added to a model to break data dependencies
% between blocks and create concurrency, that delay needs to be accounted
% for in other parts of the model. Signals that do not go into the dataflow
% region of the model will not experience this delay. These signals must be
% delayed in order to align with signals that were processed and delayed by
% the dataflow region if the signals are to be combined or compared. This

%% Block to Thread Allocation
% Now that we have created a dataflow region by putting the data-driven
% part of the model in a Dataflow Subsystem and allowed for latency, we can
% see that the model is partitioned into 4 threads using the Dataflow
% Multithreading Analysis app. To open this app, double-click on the
% Dataflow Multithreading Analysis App block in the model. The Thread
% Timing diagram in this app shows how each block is assigned to execute in

%% Multithreaded Simulation
% Here we run the multithreaded model, measure its execution time, and
% compare it to running the model in a single thread. By creating a
% dataflow region in the model it enabled Simulink to automatically
% partition the blocks in the dataflow region into concurrent execution
