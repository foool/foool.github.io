%% Using Dataflow to Take Advantage of Inherent Parallelism in Models
% This example uses dataflow, a data-driven domain in Simulink, to take
% advantage of inherent parallelism in the system and run the audio
% processing system simulation multithreaded. This example shows how to
% beamform signals received by an array of microphones to extract a desired
% speech signal in a noisy environment.

%% About Dataflow
% With dataflow, blocks inside the domain execute based on arrival of data
% as opposed to Simulink's sample time, and models are automatically
% partitioned into concurrent threads that accelerate simulation and
% increase data throughput. For an introduction to dataflow see the
% <matlab:web(fullfile(matlabroot,'toolbox','shared','dataflow','dataflowdemos','html','slexDataflowIntroductionExample_publish.html'))
% Introduction to Dataflow for Multithreading in Simulink> example. To take
% advantage of the dataflow domain, hence multithreaded simulation, your
% model or section of your model must only have discrete-time blocks. Using
% Dataflow Subsystems we can delineate the region of the model where
% dataflow semantics, as opposed to Simulink's sample time, is used to sort
% and execute blocks. Moreover, you cannot have blocks that access time,
% require a Simulink solver, or do not support code generation. Signals
% inside the Dataflow Subsystem don't have a sample time associated with
% them. Signals output from the Dataflow Subsystem will be associated with
% the sample time of the signal before it entered the Dataflow Subsystem.
% All the blocks inside the Dataflow Subsystem form a dataflow region in
% the model.

%% Acoustic Beamforming
% This example shows acoustic beamforming using a uniform linear array
% (ULA) of microphones. The model simulates the reception of three audio
% signals from different directions on a 10-element uniformly spaced linear
% microphone array. After the addition of thermal noise at the receiver,
% beamforming is applied for different source angles and the result is
% played on a sound device. The audio source that needs to be played in the
% audio player can be selected using the dialog from the "Select Source"
% block. This example shows how Simulink automatically partitions the
% dataflow part of the model to take advantage of inherent parallelism in
% the system and run the audio processing system simulation multithreaded.

%% Inherent Parallelism
% There is lots of inherent parallelism in this model since the three
% "Frost Beamformer" blocks can run independently. But all the beamformer
% blocks are data dependent on "Microphone Array" and "Receiver Preamp"
% blocks. Adding pipeline delays would remove this dependency and increase
% concurrency for this model. You can analyze this by using the Dataflow
% Multithreading Analysis app. You can open this app by double-clicking on
% the Dataflow Multithreading Analysis App block in the model. In this app
% you can view the speedup that can be achieved for different delay values
% by choosing the menu option "Analysis->Performance Tradeoff->Speedup &
% Threads vs. Delays". The app shows that for 0 delays the estimated
% speedup that can be obtained is about 2.8x. This is possible because the
% 3 "Frost Beamformer" blocks are computationally intensive as well as they
% can run independently. Dataflow can partition this model and gain nearly
% 3x performance improvement by scheduling the 3 "Frost Beamformer" blocks
% to run in 3 different threads. The app also shows that we can get
% increased concurrency and thereby speedup by increasing the pipeline
% delay to 1. This is because introducing a pipeline delay after "Receiver
% Preamp" block will break the data dependency of the "Frost Beamformer"
% blocks on their sources, thereby enabling "Microphone Array" and
% "Receiver Preamp" blocks to be moved into a separate thread. The
% estimated speedup increases to 3.1x after adding this pipeline delay.

%% Multithreaded Simulation
% The dataflow region in the model enabled Simulink to automatically
% partition the model by extracting inherent parallelism and placing the
% computationally intensive "Frost Beamformer" blocks in separate threads.
% When you simulate this model it runs using multiple threads. The audio
% player plays one of the three audio sources depending on the source
% selected using the "Select Source" block.

%% Thread Allocation Results
% Different threads used by the model can be seen by turning thread
% highlighting "on" using the menu option "Display->Highlight Dataflow
% Threads" in the model. For this model 4 different threads are used. These
% are shown using 4 different colors in the model. In this example, all of
% the 3 "Frost Beamformer" blocks run in different threads, while the
% "Microphone Array" and the "Receiver Preamp" blocks run in the same
% thread. The Thread Legend window can be used to selectively highlight
% only some threads for inspecting the model.

%% Summary
% This example shows how an audio processing system simulation model can
% use dataflow to automatically partition the data-driven part of the model
% into concurrent execution threads and run the model using multiple
% threads. This example shows an estimated speedup of 3.1x over
% single-threaded simulation using 4 threads. The Dataflow Multithreading
% Analysis app shows how different blocks are scheduled to run in parallel
% and how introducing pipeline delays between blocks breaks data dependency
% between blocks and increases concurrency. Note that depending on the
% desktop computer system and the processor you are using, the numbers and
% visualization showed could be different when you run the same model in
% your computer. These numbers and analysis were published on a Windows
% desktop computer with Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1650 v3 @ 3.4 GHz 6 Cores
